# file-catalog
A file catalogging library in C++

## What is this
A tool to help find, store, and manage files. Its primary purpose is to catalog, 
but many other features (that have already been designed), are planned to be
developed soon.

HOWEVER, it is not yet a tool. It will be a library for the time being.

## How to build
All headers go in the same folder or alternatively use -I to include the
directory. Make sure to do --recursive when you do a clone, as I use my
custom [Moorepp](http://localhost/) framework.
You could also try my [build file](https://github.com/MrDoritos/file-catalog/blob/master/build.sh) for g++.
